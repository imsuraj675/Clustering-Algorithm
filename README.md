Introduction
In today's digital era, effective document clustering is vital for extracting meaningful insights from vast amounts of data. This paper presents an innovative approach to optimize document clustering through correlation-driven techniques. Our methodology focuses on dynamically adjusting cluster sizes and reducing errors by implementing correlation-based thresholding.

Methodology
The methodology integrates a sophisticated pipeline, including tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization. Central to our approach is the implementation of correlation-based thresholding, which adapts cluster sizes dynamically, enhancing flexibility and reducing misclassifications.

Experimental Setup
We conducted experiments on a dataset comprising questions from four different topics: Biotechnology, DBMS, Network and Networking, and Climate Change. The optimum threshold value was determined using the elbow method, and comparative evaluations were performed against traditional clustering algorithms.

Results
