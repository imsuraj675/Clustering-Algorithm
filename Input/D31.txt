Climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and disproportionately affects low-income and vulnerable communities. These populations often lack the resources and capacity to adapt to the changing climate, leading to a range of challenges that directly impact their livelihoods.

Rising temperatures and extreme heat events, exacerbated by climate change, pose a greater threat to low-income communities. These individuals may lack access to air conditioning, live in poorly insulated housing, and face the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to extreme heat.

Changing precipitation patterns and more frequent droughts are particularly damaging to vulnerable communities, many of whom rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Reduced precipitation and prolonged droughts can result in crop failures, food shortages, and water scarcity.

Sea-level rise and coastal erosion, driven by climate change, threaten low-lying coastal communities. These individuals often lack the financial means to adapt, relocate, or invest in resilient infrastructure, leaving them at risk of displacement and loss of livelihoods.

Vulnerable populations often experience more substantial health impacts due to climate change. The spread of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, is influenced by changing climate conditions, leading to higher rates of vector-borne diseases in these communities. Limited access to healthcare and health services compounds these challenges.

Food security is another significant concern for vulnerable communities. Climate change disrupts food production, and these communities often lack access to diverse and nutritious food sources. This can lead to malnutrition and food insecurity, with long-term consequences for public health.

In many cases, marginalized and low-income communities are more reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods, making them more vulnerable to changes in ecosystems and resource availability. This can result in economic disparities and greater social inequality.

Disasters triggered or exacerbated by climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. These individuals often have inadequate access to early warning systems, emergency services, and disaster preparedness resources, leading to higher casualties and greater losses.

To address these challenges and mitigate the disproportionate impact on low-income and vulnerable communities, targeted strategies are required. These include investing in climate resilience, ensuring equitable access to resources and services, implementing policies that protect vulnerable populations, and involving these communities in decision-making processes. Climate justice principles emphasize the need to address these disparities and empower marginalized communities to adapt to the changing climate while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow the progression of climate change.
