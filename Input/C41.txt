Database views play a crucial role in simplifying complex queries and data access in a database management system. They provide an abstraction layer over the underlying tables and offer several benefits for users and applications:

Data Abstraction:

Database views act as virtual tables that encapsulate the complexity of underlying tables. They present a simplified and structured view of data to users, abstracting the underlying schema.
Simplification of Querying:

Views simplify the process of querying by allowing users to access data through a well-defined interface. Users can write queries against the view without needing to understand the underlying table structures and relationships.
Data Security:

Views can enhance data security by limiting access to specific columns or rows of data. Database administrators can define view permissions, ensuring that users only see the data they are authorized to access.
Data Restructuring:

Views can restructure data by combining columns from different tables, applying data transformations, or filtering data based on specific criteria. This is particularly useful for creating custom data representations.
Complex Joins and Aggregations:

Views can simplify complex joins and aggregations by predefining them. Users can query the view to obtain aggregated data or retrieve results of multi-table joins without having to write intricate queries repeatedly.
Business Logic Implementation:

Views can incorporate business logic and calculations into data access. This allows for consistent data transformations, calculations, or data validations to be applied transparently to all users.
Consistency:

Views ensure data consistency by providing a standardized view of data. Users and applications interact with views in a consistent way, reducing the risk of data errors or inconsistencies.
Performance Optimization:

Views can be used to optimize query performance. They can be designed to materialize or cache query results, reducing the overhead of running resource-intensive queries repeatedly.
Security and Compliance:

Views help enforce security and compliance policies. Sensitive or regulated data can be accessed through views with restricted permissions, ensuring compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.
Data Versioning and Historical Data:

Views can be used to create snapshots or historical views of data at specific points in time. This is useful for analyzing historical data and tracking changes over time.
Data Independence:

Views promote data independence, as changes to the underlying table structures can be abstracted from users and applications. As long as the view definition remains the same, users are shielded from structural changes.
Simplifying Reporting:

Views simplify reporting tasks by providing pre-structured data. Reporting tools can query views to generate reports and dashboards more efficiently.
Customization:

Views can be customized for different user groups or applications. Views can present data in a way that is most relevant and efficient for specific users.
