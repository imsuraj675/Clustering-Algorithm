Binary Relationship: A binary relationship in an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram involves two distinct entity types and represents an association or connection between them. For example, a binary relationship could be used to depict the connection between "Student" and "Course," where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students. Binary relationships are among the most common in ER modeling.

Ternary Relationship: A ternary relationship, on the other hand, involves three distinct entity types and represents an association or interaction between them. Ternary relationships are less common and are used when a situation requires modeling a connection that cannot be adequately expressed by two binary relationships. An example of a ternary relationship could be a "Project" involving "Employee," "Task," and "Department," where an employee works on a task within a department as part of a project. Ternary relationships are depicted using a diamond shape with three lines connecting the participating entities.
