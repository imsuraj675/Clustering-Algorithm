A network switch and a network router are two different devices used in computer networks, each serving distinct functions. Here's an explanation of each and the key differences between them:

Network Switch:

A network switch is a hardware device used in local area networks (LANs) to connect and manage multiple devices within the same network, such as computers, printers, servers, and other networked devices. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) and use MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to determine where to forward data packets.
Key Characteristics and Functions of a Network Switch:

Layer 2 Device: Switches operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model, focusing on MAC addresses, and they are responsible for forwarding data frames within the same network segment.

Efficient Data Transfer: Switches use a switching table (also called a MAC table) to learn the MAC addresses of connected devices and use this information to efficiently forward data frames only to the specific port where the destination device is located. This reduces network congestion and enhances network performance.

Broadcast Domains: A switch creates a separate broadcast domain for each of its ports. This means that broadcast traffic is contained within the segment where it originates and doesn't propagate to other segments.

LAN Connectivity: Switches are commonly used to build and expand local area networks, connecting devices within a building or a specific area.

Network Router:

A network router is a device that connects multiple networks together and directs traffic between them. Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and use logical IP addresses to determine where to forward data packets.
Key Characteristics and Functions of a Network Router:

Layer 3 Device: Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, making routing decisions based on logical IP addresses.

Interconnecting Networks: Routers are used to interconnect different networks, such as LANs, MANs, or WANs. They determine the best path for data packets to travel between networks.

Network Address Translation (NAT): Routers often perform NAT, allowing multiple devices within a LAN to share a single public IP address. This enables multiple internal devices to access the internet using a single external IP address.

Firewall and Security: Many routers include firewall capabilities to provide network security by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic and blocking malicious activity.

WAN Connectivity: Routers are commonly used at the edge of a network to connect to the internet or link multiple LANs across wide area networks (WANs).

Key Differences:

Function: A switch connects devices within the same network, focusing on local data forwarding. A router connects different networks and makes decisions about how to route data between them.

Layer: Switches operate at Layer 2, while routers operate at Layer 3.

Addressing: Switches use MAC addresses for forwarding, while routers use IP addresses.

Broadcast Domains: A switch separates devices into multiple broadcast domains, but routers naturally separate different networks into distinct broadcast domains.

In summary, network switches and routers serve different roles in network infrastructure. Switches facilitate local data transfer and are commonly used within LANs, while routers interconnect different networks, make routing decisions between them, and often include firewall and NAT functionalities for network security and internet connectivity. Both devices are essential components in modern network architectures.
